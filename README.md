## Twin Peaks: The Return

This is a simple static site I created as a pre-work assignment for a web development program I've enrolled in at Rithm School in San Francisco. It was initially just a list of episode summaries for the third season of Twin Peaks, but I'm experimenting with additional content such as short actor biographies. I plan to add a page about filming locations next.

It is also an exercise in learning Bootstrap and experimenting with responsive design.

Apologies in advance for Albert. And remember, the owls are not what they seem.
