      <h1>Episode Summaries</h1>
      <p class="lead"><b>In the early 1990s, residents of the quaint northwestern town of Twin Peaks were stunned by the murder
        of homecoming queen Laura Palmer. Twenty-five years later, Special Agent Dale Cooper, who investigated the student's death,
        heads out on an odyssey that returns him to the Washington town. Creator David Lynch directs all 18 episodes of this
        long-awaited follow-up to the cult classic series that originally aired from 1990-91 and spawned the 1992 prequel film,
        <i>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me.</i></b></p>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">Dale Cooper remains trapped in the Black Lodge. In Twin Peaks, Dr. Jacoby
        receives a shipment of shovels. At the Great Northern, Ben Horne introduces his brother Jerry to his new secretary,
        Beverly. Deputy Chief Hawk gets a call from the Log Lady, who tells him some evidence relating to Dale Cooper is missing.
        In New York City, Sam Colby sits in a warehouse watching a glass box. Tracey Barberato visits him. With the security
        guard absent during Tracey's second visit, Sam lets her into the room. As they have sex, a pale androgynous entity
        materializes in the glass box and murders them. In Buckhorn, South Dakota, Cooper's doppelgänger—a sinister, long-haired
        man with black irises—retrieves two associates, Ray and Darya. Police find the severed head of Buckhorn librarian Ruth
        Davenport placed on the headless body of a John Doe. Local principal Bill Hastings's fingerprints are found and he is
        arrested. Bill denies guilt, but fumbles his alibi.</div>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">Bill Hastings's wife, Phyllis, accuses him of having an affair, while Phyllis has
        been having an affair with Bill's lawyer, George. A ghostly entity occupies another cell. Phyllis is murdered at home by
        Cooper's doppelgänger. Attempting to obtain information through Darya, Ray, and another associate, Jack, Cooper's
        doppelgänger perceives that his associates have turned on him. He murders Jack and Darya, learning that the three were
        hired to kill him. He reveals that he is due to return to the Black Lodge, but has a plan to avoid this. In the Black
        Lodge, Cooper encounters Laura and Leland Palmer, MIKE, and an evolved form of The Man from Another Place, now a skeletal
        tree with a featureless head. It tells Cooper that he cannot leave before his doppelgänger has returned, but the tree's
        doppelgänger intervenes. The floor of the Black Lodge gives way and Cooper falls into the glass box in New York, then into
        space. In Twin Peaks, Hawk continues his investigation into the Log Lady's cryptic words, and James Hurley shares a
        nostalgic moment with Shelly Johnson at the Roadhouse.</div>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">Cooper lands in a metal building where two women appear to protect him from an unseen
        entity. Cooper's doppelgänger becomes sick while driving and crashes. Cooper finds a portal and swaps places with a second
        Cooper doppelgänger, Dougie Jones, who just had sex with Jade, a Las Vegas prostitute. In the Black Lodge, MIKE tells Dougie
        that he was manufactured for a purpose that has been fulfilled. Dougie turns into a tiny gold bead and MIKE takes his ring.
        Cooper is found in a disoriented state by Jade, who mistakes him for Dougie and drops him off at a casino. As he wanders in
        a state of confusion, he plays slot machines indicated with hallucinatory images of the Black Lodge, winning megajackpots
        every time. At the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department, Hawk, Andy and Lucy are unable to discern what is "missing". At the FBI
        headquarters in Philadelphia, Agent Tamara Preston is debriefing Gordon Cole and Albert Rosenfield when Cole receives a phone
        call stating that Cooper has been found in South Dakota.</div>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">Cooper wins 28 consecutive megajackpots at the casino, totaling $425,000, then is driven
        to Dougie's home. Dougie's wife, Janey-E, is upset about her husband's three-day disappearance, but she is relieved that they
        can pay his $20,000 gambling debt ($52,000 after interest). Still near-catatonic, Cooper settles into life as Dougie. While
        getting dressed, he sees a vision of MIKE, who informs him that either he or his remaining doppelgänger must die. At the Sheriff's
        Department, Sheriff Frank Truman gets an update on Hawk's investigation, and Deputy Bobby Briggs recalls that Cooper was the last
        person to see his father, Major Garland Briggs, before his death. Andy and Lucy's son Wally Brando arrives at the Sheriff's Office
        to pay his respects to his sick godfather, Harry. Gordon meets with FBI Chief of Staff Denise Bryson before heading to South
        Dakota with Albert and Tamara to see Cooper. Cooper's doppelgänger claims he has been working undercover for Special Agent
        Philip Jeffries. Gordon and Albert discuss their misgivings about Cooper, and decide to seek the one woman they think can help them.</div>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">Janey-E drops Cooper at Dougie's workplace, where he reacts to a statue outside, the smell
        of coffee, and the words "agent" and "case files". After a light illuminates a colleague's face, Cooper accuses him of lying,
        angering his boss. The young boy who lives across the street from where Dougie's car is parked goes over to investigate it, when
        a group of thugs break into it, causing an explosion. The Mitchums beat and fire the casino supervisor, accusing him of complicity
        in Cooper's winning streak. Jade drops Cooper's Great Northern Hotel room key in a mailbox. In Twin Peaks, Shelly lends money to
        her daughter Becky, who leaves with her husband and takes cocaine. Dr. Jacoby broadcasts conspiracy theory videos to sell his
        golden shovels, with Jerry Horne and Nadine Hurley among his viewers. Cooper's doppelgänger makes a phone call in prison that
        causes the security system to go haywire. In Buckhorn, an autopsy of the decapitated body reveals Dougie's wedding ring in the
        stomach. At the Pentagon, Colonel Davis is informed that the fingerprints on the Buckhorn body match Garland Briggs's – the
        sixteenth set of his prints they have found in 25 years.</div>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">Police take Cooper to Dougie's home and Janey-E receives a photo of Dougie with Jade.
        Cooper draws cryptic images on Dougie's case files, guided by lights on the pages. Dougie's boss recognizes a pattern in the
        drawings and thanks Cooper. Cooper has another vision of MIKE telling him to wake up. Janey-E meets the two criminals demanding
        $52,000 from Dougie and gives them $25,000, calling it her "only offer." Duncan Todd receives a message on his laptop and pulls
        an envelope marked with a black spot from his safe. Hitman Ike "The Spike" Stadtler receives an identical envelope containing
        photos of Dougie and Lorraine, and kills Lorraine and her coworkers. Albert finds Diane, Cooper's assistant, in a bar. In Twin
        Peaks, Richard Horne meets drug supplier Red. He speeds recklessly in his truck, running over and killing a young boy. Carl
        Rodd witnesses the incident and attempts to comfort the boy's mother. Hawk drops a coin in the bathroom and sees that the stall
        manufacturer's logo is a Nez Percé chief. Noticing two screws missing from the stall door, he finds several written pages inside.</div>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">Hawk and Frank Truman examine the pages torn from Laura's diary. One entry describes a
        dream in which Annie tells Laura that the good Dale is trapped in the Lodge. Frank calls Doc Hayward, who recounts his memories
        of the day Cooper returned from the Lodge. Lt. Knox arrives in Buckhorn and is stunned to learn that Garland Briggs's fingerprints
        come from a body in its late forties, not seventies. Albert and Gordon convince Diane to speak to Cooper in prison. She is upset
        by the conversation and tells Gordon the man is not Cooper. Andy arranges to meet the farmer who owns the truck driven by Richard
        Horne in the hit-and-run, but he never arrives. Cooper's doppelgänger blackmails Warden Murphy into releasing him and Ray. Police
        visit Cooper at Dougie's workplace to question him about Dougie's destroyed car. As he leaves with Janey-E, Ike runs at them with
        a gun, but Cooper expertly disarms him as the Man from Another Place appears urging him to "squeeze his hand off". Beverly tries
        to locate the source of a mysterious hum in Ben Horne's office, then returns home to her terminally ill husband, Tom.</div>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">Ray shoots Cooper's doppelgänger. Ghostly men tear at his body, revealing a sac with
        BOB's face. Ray flees, leaving Jeffries a message that the doppelgänger may have survived. Later, the doppelgänger awakens. In
        1945 New Mexico, the first atomic bomb is detonated. A convenience store is occupied by ghostly men. Floating in a void, an androgynous
        being spews a stream of fluid; one globule manifests BOB's face. In a building above a purple sea, the Giant watches the detonation,
        the convenience store, and BOB. He levitates, light emanating from his head. Señorita Dido enters, and an orb with Laura Palmer’s
        face inside floats down to her. She sends the orb to Earth. In 1956 New Mexico, a creature hatches from an egg. A woodsman descends
        to the ground, then enters a radio station and kills the receptionist. Overpowering the disc jockey, he repeatedly broadcasts the
        words "This is the water and this is the well. Drink full and descend. The horse is the white of the eyes and dark within," rendering
        listeners unconscious. The creature enters an unconscious girl's room and climbs into her mouth. The woodsman kills the disc jockey
        and leaves.</div>

        the farmers. He sends a text message to Diane and calls Duncan Todd to ask if a job has been done. He orders the warden killed and
        drives away. The Las Vegas police discover no record of Dougie Jones before 1997, and take fingerprints from his coffee mug. They
        arrest Ike "the Spike". Jerry Horne hallucinates in the woods. Johnny Horne is found seriously injured. Bobby visits his mother
        with sheriff Truman and Hawk to ask about Cooper; she tells them her husband long ago foretold their arrival. She gives them a small
        metal cylinder containing instructions about a location, date, and Cooper's name, written twice. The FBI stops in Buckhorn to examine
        the body of Major Briggs. Tammy questions Hastings, who says he and Ruth visited Briggs in another another dimension, where he had
        been hibernating for years, and witnessed his beheading while someone said the name Cooper. His lawyer is arrested for the murder of
        his wife. At the Bang Bang Bar, a girl scratches a serious rash.</div>
