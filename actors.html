        <h4 class="actor-name">David Lynch</h4>
        <h4 class="character-name">FBI Deputy Director Gordon Cole</h4>
        <p>Born: 20 Jan 1946, Missoula, Montana, USA</p>
        <p>David Lynch is an American director, screenwriter, producer, painter, musician, actor, and photographer. He has been
          described by The Guardian as "the most important director of this era".</p>
        <p>Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States, before going on to study painting at the Pennsylvania
          Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia. He later moved to Los Angeles,
          where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film <i>Eraserhead</i> (1977). After <i>Eraserhead</i> became a cult
          classic, Lynch was employed to direct a biographical film about a deformed man, Joseph Merrick,
          titled <i>The Elephant Man</i> (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. His two next films were the science-fiction epic <i>Dune</i> 
          (1984) and then a neo-noir crime film <i>Blue Velvet</i> (1986), which stirred
          controversy over its violence but grew in critical reputation later on.</p>
        <p>Next, Lynch created his own television series with Mark Frost, the popular murder mystery <i>Twin Peaks</i> (1990–1991). He also
          created a cinematic prequel, <i>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</i> (1992), a road movie <i>Wild at Heart</i> (1990) and a family film <i>The
          Straight Story</i> (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films
          operated on "dream logic" non-linear narrative structures: the psychological thriller <i>Lost Highway</i> (1997), the neo-noir
          "love story" <i>Mulholland Drive</i> (2001) and the fragmented mystery film <i>Inland Empire</i> (2006). Lynch and Frost reunited in 2017
          for the Showtime limited series <i>Twin Peaks: The Return</i>, with Lynch co-writing and directing.</p>
